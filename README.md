# Code Style Enforcer

## Motto

**"A teammate that never forgets your standards."**

---

# Overview

Code Style Enforcer is an AI-powered code review assistant that helps development teams maintain consistent coding standards.

Unlike traditional linters that rely on static configuration files, Code Style Enforcer stores coding standards in persistent memory using Parcle and applies them when reviewing code snippets.

Developers can paste JavaScript code into the application and instantly receive:

- Style violations
- Rule explanations
- Suggested fixes
- Team-standard enforcement

---

# Problem Statement

Development teams often define coding standards but fail to enforce them consistently.

Traditional linters:

- Require manual configuration
- Cannot explain rules intelligently
- Do not remember team-specific conventions
- Cannot leverage persistent memory

This project solves that problem by combining AI-style memory with automated code analysis.

---

# Features

### Rule Enforcement

The application checks code against team standards:

- camelCase Naming
- No console.log Statements
- Function Comment Requirement
- No Hardcoded Secrets

---

### Intelligent Feedback

Each violation includes:

- Rule Name
- Suggested Fix

Example:

```text
Rule: Use camelCase
Fix: Replace snake_case with camelCase
```

---

### Persistent Memory

Coding standards are stored in Parcle memory and retrieved whenever code is analyzed.

This allows the system to remember team standards across sessions.

# Technology Stack

## Frontend

- React
- Vite
- Axios

## Backend

- Python
- Flask
- Flask-CORS

## Memory Layer

- Parcle

# Tool Integration

## Parcle

Parcle enables persistent memory by storing team coding standards and retrieving them whenever code is analyzed, ensuring consistent rule enforcement across sessions.

Stored information:

- Coding standards
- Team rules
- Check history
- Memory retrieval

Example Rule:

```text
Variables and functions must use camelCase.
```

When code is submitted:

1. Rules are retrieved from Parcle
2. Code is analyzed
3. Violations are returned
4. Results are displayed to the user

# Demo

Sample Input:

```javascript
const user_name = "John";
const api_key = "12345";

console.log(user_name);

function calculate_total(a, b) {
  return a + b;
} 
```

Expected Output:

```text
Use camelCase
No console.log
Missing function comment
Hardcoded secret detected

```
